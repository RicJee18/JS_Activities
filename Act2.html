        <h1>My College Life</h1>

    <p style="width:90%; text-align: justify;" > &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before I tell you my college life story, I am going to introduce myself first. So, I am <strong>Jeric Baterna</strong>, 20 years old.
        A Passerelles Numeriques scholar and currently living here in Nasipit, Talamban Cebu City. You can see me at
        Samjung Building. Besides, I am very proud to be part of <strong>USC - Carolinians</strong>. First and foremost, I would like to
        express my deepest gratitude to <strong>PN</strong> for having this kind of opportunity that can showcase my potentials and
        expand my learnings technically.
        <br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;College life is somewhat like the final stage you need to surpass, the final
        door rather. After entering this, you can be something different pretty sure. Yes, <strong>Success</strong> is the product of
        struggle. Why I am talking here about the struggle it’s because this thing is part of our journey all along.
        Having <strong>IT</strong> as a course is not my first choice. I’m not fond of doing this before. Information Technology needs
        deeper <strong> understanding, analysis, logical thinking, problem solving, decision making, and such</strong>. It is not that
        easy and should be judged. At first, I’m so worried about what might happen next. If I can do it or what if I
        might fail? All I have that time are those queries and negative thoughts randomly beading in my head. While
        having my first subject turned to first class turned to first semester and turned to first year, it was like
        living in a world that was full of <strong>adjustments, responsibilities, and complex missions</strong>.<br>
        <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the long run, I’m
        getting used to it and I am slowly <strong>dancing with the flow</strong> . I started exploring myself to the life of a <strong>programmer</strong>
        and understanding their way of coping stress. Finding errors. Have some trouble shooting and worst is doing
        codes on your own. Today, I could say that I enjoyed and had some fun with this course. I am having a new friends and a family. And finally realize that being an IT is the life where I am supposed to be. </p>
